    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Partial differential equations (PDEs) are involved in the description of virtually every physical situation where quantities vary in space, or in space and time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples are diffusion, electromagnetic waves, hydrodynamics, quantum mechanics. \n",
    "\n",
    "In all but the simplest cases, equations cannot be solved analytically, and so numerical methods must be employed for quantitative results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The typical numerical approach proceeds as follows: the dependent variables (e.g. temperature, electrical potential), are described by their values at discrete points (a lattice) of the independent variables (e.g. space and time). \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by appropriate discretization, the PDE is reduced to a large set of *difference equations*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although difference equations can be solved by matrix methods, the large size of the matrices involved (dimension $\\sim$ number of lattice points), makes this approach impractical. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the locality of the original equations (i.e. they involved only low-order derivatives of the dependent variables) makes the resulting differential equations \"sparse\", which implies that most of the elements of the matrices involved vanish. \n",
    "\n",
    "For such matrices, iterative methods of inversion and diagonalization can be very efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the physically-important PDEs are of second order, and can be classified into three types: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Parabolic:* Roughly speaking, parabolic equations involve only a first-order derivative in one variable, but have second-order derivatives in the remaining variables. Examples the diffusion equation, or the time-dependent Schrödinger equation: they are first order in time, but second order in space. \n",
    "3. *Elliptic:* They have second order derivatives in each of the independent variables, each derivative having the *same sign* when all terms of the equation are grouped on one side. Examples are the Poisson equation for the electrical potential and the time-independent Schrödinger equation, in two or more spatial variables. \n",
    "4. *Hyperbolic:* They involve second derivatives of opposite sign, e.g. the wave equation describing the vibrations of a stretched string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss some numerical methods appropriate for *elliptic* equations and then focus on *parabolic* equations. Hyperbolic equations often can be treated by similar methods, with some unique differences (we won't discuss these here). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Elliptic Partial Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "For concreteness, we will consider particular forms of elliptic boundary value and eigenvalue problems for a field $\\phi$ in two spatial dimensions, $(x,y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will tackle the boundary value problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\right] \\phi = S(x,y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although this is not the most general elliptic form, it covers a wide variety of situations. For example, in electrostatics, $\\phi$ is the potential and $S$ is related to the charge density (i.e., it is a source term). In steady-state heat diffusion, $\\phi$ is the temperature, $S$ is the local rate of heat generation or loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "The discussion can be generalized straightforwardly to other elliptic cases, e.g. in three dimensions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the equation by itself is not complete. The boundary conditions are required. We will take the boundary conditions to be of the \"Dirichlet\" type, i.e. $\\phi$ is specified on some closed curve on the $(x,y)$ plane. Conveniently, we will take this to be the unit square, and perhaps some additional curves within it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary value problem is then to use the PDE to find $\\phi$ everywhere within the square. \n",
    "\n",
    "Other classes of boundary conditions are the \"Neumann\" type, where the normal derivative of $\\phi$ is specified on the surfaces, or the \"mixed\" type, where a linear combination of $\\phi$ and its normal derivatives is specified. Both can be handled by very similar methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalue problems we will be interested in might involve an equation of the form, \n",
    "\n",
    "$-\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\right] \\phi + V(x,y)\\phi = \\varepsilon \\phi$,\n",
    "\n",
    "together with a set of Dirichlet boundary conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, the above could be the time-independent Schrödinger equation, with $\\phi$ being the wave function, $V(x,y)$ is related to the potential and $\\varepsilon$ is related to the energy eigenvalue. \n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalue problem is then to find the values $\\varepsilon_\\lambda$ and the associated eigenfunctions $\\phi_\\lambda$, for which the equation and the b.c.'s are satisfied."

    "in a form suitable for numerical treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "We define a set of lattice points covering the region of interest in the $(x,y)$ plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "For convenience, we take the lattice spacing $h$ to be uniform and equal in both directions. Therefore, the unit square is covered by $N\\times N$ lattice squares, with points labeled by $(i,j)$, each of which runs from $0$ to $N$. The coordinates of point $(i,j)$ are $x_i = ih$ and $y_j = jh$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We then define $\\phi_{ij} = \\phi(x_i, y_j)$ and $S_{ij} = S(x_i, y_j)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is straightforward to apply a three-point difference for the second derivative (see, e.g. Chapter 9, section 2 for a derivation using a Taylor series expansion in one dimension): \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial^2 \\phi}{\\partial x^2} \\simeq \\frac{ \\phi_{i+1j} + \\phi_{i-1j} - 2 \\phi_{ij}}{h^2}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$-\\left[\\frac{ \\phi_{i+1j} + \\phi_{i-1j} - 2 \\phi_{ij}}{h^2} + \\frac{ \\phi_{ij+1} + \\phi_{ij-1} - 2 \\phi_{ij}}{h^2}\\right] = S_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variational Principle Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be solving this equation shortly, but first let's derive it in an alternate way, based on a *variational  principle*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is handy in cases where the coordinates are not Cartesian, or when more accurate formulas are needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The variational principle also provides some insnight into how the solution algorithm works. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a quantity $\\mathcal{E}$, defined to be a *functional* of the field $\\phi$, of the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{E} = \\int_0^1 \\mathrm{d} x  \\int_0^1 \\mathrm{d} y \\left[ \\frac{1}{2} (\\nabla \\phi)^2 - S \\phi \\right]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In some situations, $\\mathcal{E}$ has a physical interpretation. For example, in electrostatics, $E = -\\nabla \\phi$ is the electric field and $S$ is the charge density, making $\\mathcal{E}$ the total energy of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other situations, such as steady-state diffusion, $\\mathcal{E}$ should be viewed simply as a useful quantity. \n",
    "\n",
    "At a solution to $-\\left[ \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + \\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial y^2}\\right] \\phi = S(x,y)$, $\\mathcal{E}$ is *stationary* under all variations of the solution $\\phi$, called $\\delta \\phi$ that respect the Dirichlet boundary conditions imposed. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{E}$ being stationary implies that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta \\mathcal{E} = 0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's find an expression for $\\delta \\mathcal{E}$. The \"$\\delta$\" simply acts as any derivative would, and therefore:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\delta \\mathcal{E} = \\int_0^1 \\mathrm{d} x \\int_0^1 \\mathrm{d} y \\left[ \\mathbf{\\nabla} \\phi \\cdot \\mathbf{\\nabla} \\delta \\phi - S \\delta \\phi\\right]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the integral of the first term by parts, we need to derive an appropriate integration by parts identity in two dimensions. \n",

    "Starting with the *divergence theorem* in two dimensions for a vector field $\\mathbf{V}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "Let's also derive a discrete approximation to the $\\mathcal{E}$ functional. We employ a two-point difference formula to approximate each first derivative in $(\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\phi)^2$, at the points halfway between the lattice points, and use the trapezoid rule for the integrals. \n",

The optimal value can be determined empirically by examining the convergence of the solution for only a few iterations, before choosing a value to be used for many iterations. "
