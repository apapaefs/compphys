    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the important equations of physics can be cast in the form of a linear, second-order differential equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^2 y }  { \\mathrm{d} x^2 } + k^2 (x) y = S(x)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S(x)$ is an \"inhomogeneous\" (or \"driving\", or \"source\" term) and $k^2(x)$ is a real function. \n",
    "\n",
    "When $k^2>0$, the solutions of the homogeneous equation (i.e. with $S=0$) are oscillatory, with wavenumber $k$. \n",
    "\n",
    "When $k^2<0$, the solutions grow or decay exponentially at a rate $\\sqrt{-k^2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of such a problem is trying to find the electrostatic potential $\\Phi$, generated by a localized charge distribution $\\rho(\\mathbf{r})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The starting point would be Poisson's equation: $\\nabla^2 \\Phi = - 4 \\pi \\rho$.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that this is written in Gaussian units, where the permittivity of free space is replaced by $1/4\\pi$: $\\varepsilon_0 \\rightarrow 1/4\\pi$. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_units for further detail.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For *spherically-symmetric* $\\rho$, and hence $\\Phi$, the Poisson equation turns into:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{1}{r^2} \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} }{\\mathrm{d}r} \\left( r^2 \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}\\Phi } { \\mathrm{d} r} \\right) = - 4 \\pi \\rho$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The standard substitution: $\\Phi(r) = r^{-1} \\phi(r)$ then yields:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^2 \\phi }  { \\mathrm{d} r^2 } = -4\\pi r\\rho$, \n",
    "\n",
    "which is of the aforementioned form, with $k^2=0$ and $S=-4 \\pi r \\rho$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example is the quantum-mechanical wave function for a particle of mass $m$ and energy $E$, moving in a *central* potential $V(r)$. This can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}) = r^{-1} R(r) Y_{\\ell M} (\\theta, \\phi)$, \n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y_{\\ell M}$ are the spherical harmonics, and $\\ell, M$ are quantum numbers relevant for the angular momentum, and the *radial* wave function satisfies:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^2 R }  { \\mathrm{d} r^2 } + k^2 (r) R = 0$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k^2(r) = \\frac{2 m}{\\hbar^2} \\left[ E - \\frac{\\ell(\\ell+1)}{2 mr^2} \\hbar^2  - V(r)\\right]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The above equation is also in the general form stated above, with $S=0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "These equations appear unremarkable and readily treated by the methods discussed in Chapter 7, except for two points: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Boundary conditions imposed by the physics often appear as constraints on the dependent variable at two *separate* points. Therefore, a solution of the problem as an initial value problem is not obviously possible.\n",
    "- The (time-independent) SchrÃ¶dinger equation is an eigenvalue problem, in which we must *find* the energies that lead to physically-acceptable solutions satisfying the appropriate boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by deriving an integration algorithm particularly suited to the equations of the desired form, and discuss the boundary value and eigenvalue problems in turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The Numerov Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a particularly simple and efficient method for integrating the second-order differential equations of the desired form (i.e. without a first-order derivative). This is known as the Numerov (or Cowling's) method. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following expansions of the function $y$ about $x$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(x+h) = y(x) + h y'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y''(x) + \\frac{h^3}{6} y'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} y''''(x) + \\mathcal{O}(h^5)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(x-h) = y(x) - h y'(x) + \\frac{h^2}{2} y''(x) - \\frac{h^3}{6} y'''(x) + \\frac{h^4}{4!} y''''(x) - \\mathcal{O}(h^5)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the two together:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(x+h) + y(x-h) = 2y(x) + h^2 y''(x) +  \\frac{h^4}{12} y''''(x) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "since the $\\mathcal{O}(h^5)$ terms will cancel out due to opposite signs. \n",
    "\n",
    "After some minor rearrangements, we get a three-point approximation for the second derivative $y''(x)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y''(x) + \\frac{h^2}{12} y''''(x) + \\mathcal{O}(h^4) = \\frac{ y(x+h) + y(x-h) - 2 y(x) }{h^2}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have kept the error term $\\frac{h^2}{12} y''''(x)$, which we will further manipulate below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to that, according to the above, let's write down the the three-point approximation for the second derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y''(x_n) = \\frac{ y_{n+1} - 2 y_n + y_{n-1} } { h^2 } + \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$, \n",
    "\n",
    "where we have defined the $n$-th iteration of the independent variable as $x_n = x_0 + nh$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The differential equation itself tells us that: \n",
    "\n",
    "$y'' = -k^2 y + S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we differentiate this twice more and evaluate it at $x_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y''''(x_n) \\equiv y_n'''' = \\frac{\\mathrm{d}^2}{\\mathrm{d}x^2} \\left.\\left(-k^2 y + S\\right)\\right|_{x=x_n}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then use the three-point approximation of the second derivative derived above to deduce that:\n",
    "$y_n'''' = -\\frac{ (k^2 y)_{n+1} - 2 (k^2 y)_n + (k^2 y)_{n-1} }{h^2} + \\frac{ S_{n+1} - 2 S_n + S_{n-1}}{h^2} + \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be substituted into the \"error\" term of the three-point approximation for the second derivative $y''(x)$ to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_n'' + \\frac{h^2}{12} \\left(-\\frac{ (k^2 y)_{n+1} - 2 (k^2 y)_n + (k^2 y)_{n-1} }{h^2} + \\frac{ S_{n+1} - 2 S_n + S_{n-1}}{h^2} + \\mathcal{O}(h^2)\\right) + \\mathcal{O}(h^4) = \\frac{ y_{n+1} - 2 y_n + y_{n-1} } { h^2 }$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiplying through by $h^2$ and using the differential equation itself, i.e. $y_n'' = - (k^2y)_n + S_n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$- (k^2y)_n + S_n + \\frac{h^2}{12} \\left(-(k^2 y)_{n+1} + 2 (k^2 y)_n - (k^2 y)_{n-1} + S_{n+1} - 2 S_n + S_{n-1} \\right) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6) = y_{n+1} - 2 y_n + y_{n-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After further rearrangement, we get a recursion relation for $y_{n+1}$ in terms of $y_n$ and $y_{n-1}$, the previous two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{n+1} = \\frac{ 2(1- \\frac{5h^2}{12} k_n^2) y_n - (1+\\frac{h^2}{12} k^2_{n-1}) y_{n-1} + \\frac{h^2}{12}(S_{n+1} + 10 S_n + S_{n-1}) + \\mathcal{O}(h^6) }{ 1 + \\frac{h^2}{12} k_{n+1}^2 }$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that one can also solve for $y_{n-1}$ in terms of $y_n$ and $y_{n+1}$ to integrate backward in $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We emphasize here that the Numerov method is one more order accurate than the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method, which might be used to integrate the problem as two coupled first-order equations. The Numerov method is also more efficient, as each step requires computation of $k^2$ and $S$ at only the \"lattice\" points. \n",
