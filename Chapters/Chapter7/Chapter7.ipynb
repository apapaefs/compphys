    "\n",
    "Many of the laws of physics are formulated in terms of differential equations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the power of computational tools is that it is easy to solve almost every differential equation. E.g. one can go beyond the small displacement in the description of oscillations, and explore interesting nonlinear phenomena. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin with a recap of some mathematical preliminaries that pertain to differential equations, and then move on, in this chapter, to to discuss algorithms for solving the ordinary differential equations. \n",

    "# Mathematical Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "**ORDER**: The order of a differential equation refers to the degree of the derivative. \n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. the most general form for a *first-order* differential equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x } = f(x,y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. even if $f(x,y)$ is a nasty function of $x$ and $y$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x } = x^2 y + x^{17} + y^{13}$, \n",
    "\n",
    "the equation is still *first order*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A general form of a *second-orrder* differential equation is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^2 y } { \\mathrm{d} x^2 } + \\lambda \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x }  = f(x, \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x }, y)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The derivative on the RHS may involved any power of the first derivative as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the above, $x$ is known as the *independent* variable and $y$ is the *dependent* variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**ORDINARY VS. PARTIAL**  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Ordinary* diffrential equations contain *just one independent* variable, e.g. $x$ in our discussion. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, *partial* differential equations contain *several independent variables*. \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. the Schr√∂dinger equation in three dimensions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ i \\hbar \\frac{ \\partial \\Psi(\\vec{x},t) } {\\partial t} = -\\frac{ \\hbar^2 } { 2 m } \\left[ \\frac{ \\partial^2 \\Psi} { \\partial x^2 } + \\frac{ \\partial^2 \\Psi} { \\partial y^2 } + \\frac{ \\partial^2 \\Psi} { \\partial z^2 } \\right] + V(\\vec{x}) \\Psi(\\vec{x},t)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "is a partial differential equation with four independent variables $\\vec{x} = (x,y,z)$ and $t$, and one dependent variable $\\Psi(\\vec{x},t)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**LINEAR VS. NONLINEAR**\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the strength of computational methods is that we ar eno longer limited to solving linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *linear* equation is one in which only the first power of $y$ or of $\\mathrm{d}^n y / \\mathrm{d}x^n$ appears, e.g.: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x } = g(x) y(x)$ is *linear*, \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x } = \\lambda y(x) - \\lambda^2 y^2(x)$ is *nonlinear*. \n",
    "\n",
    "*WARNING*: An important property of linear equations is no longer valid for nonlinear equations: the principle of superposition, that lets us add solutions together to form new ones: e.g. if $A(x)$ is a solution and $B(x)$ is a solution to a linear differential equation, then their sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "$y(x) = a A(x) + b B(x)$, is also a solution, for arbritrary values of the constants $a$ and $b$. This would no longer be true for a nonlinear equation!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial and boundary conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "The general solution of a first-order differential equaiton always contains one arbitrary constant. The general solution of a second-order differential equation contains two, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "For any specific problem, these constants are fixed by the initial conditions. E.g. for a first-order equation for $y(x)$, the sole initial condition necessary is $y(x=x_0)$, i.e. the value of $y$ at some value of $x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a second-order equation, two initial conditions are required. These may e.g. be the position and velocity at some time when solving a problem involving Newton's second law of motion:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^2 y } { \\mathrm{d} t^2 } = \\frac{1}{m} F(y,t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the initial conditions, it is possible to further restrict the solutions of differential equations, e.g. through *boundary conditions* that constrain one solution to have fixed values at the boundaries of the solution space. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Dynamic form for ODEs\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general form of an ODE is a *set* of $M$ *coupled first-order* differential equations: \n",
    "\n",
    "$ \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} \\vec{y} } { \\mathrm{d} x } = \\vec{f}(x,\\vec{y})$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $x$ is the independent variable and $\\vec{y}$ is a vector of $M$ dependent variables. The vector of functions $f$ is an $M$-component vector as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Differential equations of higher order can be written in this first-order coupled form, by introducing auxiliary functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, the one-dimensional motion (in the $z$ direction), of a particle of mass $m$ under a force *field* F(z), described by the second-order differential equation (Newton's second law):\n",
    "\n",
    "$ m\\frac{ \\mathrm{d}^2 z } { \\mathrm{d} t^2 } = F(z)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If we define the momentum as: $p(t) = m \\frac{ \\mathrm{d} z } { \\mathrm{d} t }$, \n",
    "\n",
    "then Newton's law becomes two coupled first-order equations (known as Hamilton's equations):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d} p } { \\mathrm{d} t } = F(z)$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d} z } { \\mathrm{d} t } = \\frac{p}{m}$,\n",
    "\n",
    "which are of the desired general form. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is therefore sufficient to consider in detail only methods for first-order ODEs! \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the matrix structure of coupled differential equations is of this natural form, we can focus on the case where there is only one independent variable, which can be generalized readily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we will begin by consider the methods for solving: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x } = f(x,y)$, for a single dependent variable $y(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter, we will discuss methods for solving ODEs, with emphasis on the initial value problem, i.e.:\n",
    "\n",
    "Find $y(x)$ given the value of $y$ at some initial point, say $y(x=0) = y_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is the kind of problem that occurs, e.g. when we are given the initial position and momentum of a particle and we wish to find its subsequent motion. \n",
    "\n",
    "Later on, we will discuss the equally important boundary value and eigenvalue problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "# ODE Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## Euler's Method\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in the solution of $\\frac{ \\mathrm{d} y } { \\mathrm{d} x } = f(x,y)$, with the initial condition $y(x=0) = y_0$. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, we are usually interested in the value of $y$ at particular vlaue of $x$, say $x=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The general strategy is to divide the interval $[0,1]$ into a large number, $N$, of equally spaced subintervals of length $h=1/N$ and then to develop a recursion formula relating $y_n$ to $\\{y_{n-1}, y_{n-2},...\\}$, where $y_n$ is our approximation to $y(x_n = nh)$. Such a recursion formula would then allow a step-by-step integration of the differential equation from $x=0$ to $x=1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest algorithms is known as Euler's method, in which we consider the differential equation at the point $x_n$, and replace the derivative on the LHS by its forward-difference approximation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{ y_{n+1} - y_n } { h } + \\mathcal{O}(h) = f(x_n , y_n)$, \n",
    "\n",
    "so that, if we solve for $y_{n+1}$, we obtain a recursion relation expressing $y_{n+1}$ in terms of the \"previous\" value, $y_n$: \n",
    "\n",
    "$y_{n+1} = y_n + h f(x_n, y_n) + \\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula has a \"local\" error (i.e. the error made in taking a single step from $y_n \\rightarrow y_{n+1}$, that is $\\mathcal{O}(h^2)$. The \"global\" error made in finding $y(1)$, after taking $N$ such steps in integrating from $x=0$ to $x=1$ is then $N \\mathcal{O}(h^2) \\sim \\frac{1}{h} \\mathcal{O}(h^2) \\sim \\mathcal{O}(h)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Evidently, this error decreases only linearly with decreasing step size, so that if we halve $h$ (and perform twice as many steps), we halve the error of the final answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply this method to a simple problem."
