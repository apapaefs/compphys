# Computational Physics I - PHYS 3500K

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to Computational Physics I (PHYS 3500K) at Kennesaw State University. Here, you will find examples and notes pertaining to the course, as well as additional material. 

Note that the repository is meant to evolve during the semester. Solutions to the homework problems will also appear here after the deadline has passed. 

## Getting started with the repository

### Default Option: Use this if your are unfamiliar with UNIX-like operating systems, git, Python environments, etc.: 

This course is taught primarily using this repository, conjunction with Binder: 

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gl/apapaefs%2Fcompphys/HEAD)

To access the environment necessary to run the course material, you simply need to click the link above. This will generate a docker image with the necessary pre-requisites for the course material. It will also load all the files available in the repository.

### Advanced Option: Your own environment
If you are familiar with git and version control, as well as confident that you can maintain your own Python environment and jupyter, you can go ahead and clone the repository locally: 

```git clone https://github.com/apapaefs/compphys```

To update the repository to the latest version at any instant:

```git pull```

within the directory of the repository.
